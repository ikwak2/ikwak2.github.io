  I am a Data Scientist working at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/">Samsung Research</a>; research in AI security, statistical genetics. <br> <br>

      
  I received BS in mathematics in 2006, from Korea University, and a MS in statistics in 2008, under supervison of <a href="http://faculty.korea.ac.kr/kufaculty/stat420/index.do">Myung-Hoe Huh</a>. I got a PhD in statistics in 2014, from the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>; My PhD advisor was <a href="https://kbroman.org/pages/about.html"> Karl Broman</a>. I was a postdoctoral associate with <a href="http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~weip/">Wei Pan</a> and <a href="https://www.stemcell.umn.edu/bio/stem-cell-ins-faculty-staff/daniel-garry">Daniel Garry</a> at the <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota-Twin Cities</a>, 2014-2017. I am now working at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/">Samsung Research</a> from 2017. <br><br>

          
  I am applied statistician focusing on problems in AI security and statistical genetics. I am eager to design new methods for big and complicated data. I am also excited to develop new useable tools for the method so that those methods can be widely adopted and used by other researchers. <br><br>
